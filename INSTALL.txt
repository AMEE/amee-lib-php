AMEE REST API PEAR Library Install Instructions
-----------------------------------------------

The AMEE REST API PEAR library is intended to ultimately be installed via PEAR.
At the present time, however, the library has not yet been submitted for
inclusion in the PEAR repository - AMEE will do this shortly. Until then, the
library can easily be installed manually:

1. Ensure that you have PEAR installed. If you need to install PEAR, please
    follow the instructions at http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.php.

2. Locate your PEAR library installation path. You can do this easily by running
    the command "pear config-show", and by locating the value of the
    "PEAR directory" (e.g. /usr/lib/php).

3. Download the AMEE REST API PEAR library from
    http://my.amee.com/developers/wiki/AmeeClients/PHP, if you have not already
    done so.

4. Copy the AMEE REST API PEAR library Services_AMEE.zip file into the PEAR
    library installation path from step #2 above.

5. Unzip the Services_AMEE.zip file. In your PEAR library installation path you
    should now see the Services/AMEE directory, e.g. /usr/lib/php/Services/AMEE.

The AMEE REST API PEAR library is now installed, and ready for use.

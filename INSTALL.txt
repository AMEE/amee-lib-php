AMEE REST API PEAR Library Install Instructions
-----------------------------------------------

The AMEE REST API PEAR library is intended to ultimately be installed via PEAR.
At the present time, however, the library has not yet been submitted for
inclusion in the PEAR repository - AMEE will do this shortly. Until then, the
library can easily be installed manually:

1. Ensure that you have PEAR installed. If you need to install PEAR, please
    follow the instructions at http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.php.

2. Download the AMEE REST API PEAR library from
    http://github.com/AMEE/amee-lib-php/downloads, if you have not already
    done so.

3. Locate your PEAR library installation path. You can do this easily by running
    the command "pear config-show", and by locating the value of the
    "PEAR directory" (e.g. /usr/lib/php).

4. Unzip or untar the AMEE REST API PEAR library download. This will create a
    new directory prefixed with "AMEE-amee-lib-php-". The exact name of the
    directory will depend on the version of the library.

5. Copy the contents of the library's Services/ directory into the Services/
    directory in your PEAR library installation path. You may need to create
    this directory if it does not exist. For example:

        cd /usr/lib/php
        mkdir -p Services
        cp -r /path/to/download/AMEE-amee-lib-php-1b234d5/Services/* \
            /usr/lib/php/Services/

The AMEE REST API PEAR library is now installed, and ready for use.
